\subsection{Motivation}

There are many complications when developing multi agent systems,
our goal with this project was to lessen one of these by designing
an engine with the specific purpose to develop multi agent environments.
What these environments can be is left to the developer, however almost
everything in the engine is modular and interchangeable, ensuring
that all types of multi agent environments are possible. 

What the types of projects can be is manyfold but here are some possible
examples:


\paragraph*{Agent comparison software }

There are many different languages in which it is possible to write
agent programs, some are specifically designed for it others are powerful
enough to accommodate the possibility of agent programming. Our engine
is designed with support for multiple languages at once which makes
this engine a perfect candidate for designing a comparator program. 

For instance, if two groups wanted to test their agent programs against
each other, this engine would make it possible for them to easily
design a world in which this test could occur.


\paragraph*{Agent testing/Simulation software}

Testing agent software can be complicated. Being able to rapidly create
an environment and visualize it can be important to the project, as
it ensure basic mistakes are ironed out before larger scale implementation. 


\paragraph*{Agent teaching tools}

Teaching agent languages can be tough without proper exercises; however,
the time spent on designing these exercises can prove too exhausting
for the teacher to develop. In this case the teacher can rapidly design
the world he had in mind for his exercise instead of designing every
integral part of the multi agent system himself. This is because our
engine provides all the basic features of a multi agent system, so
that the time can be spent more productively on designing how a given
exercise should play out, showcasing the problem the students are
supposed to deal with.


\paragraph*{Computer games}

In theory most computer games are just multi agent programs where
one of the agents is controlled by the player. Our engine should make
it fairly easy for setting up a framework for creating rules inside
a given world and ensure that the agents of the world follow said
rules. \texttt{\emph{{[}Expand{]}}}
