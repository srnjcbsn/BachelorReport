\chapter{Acknowledgements}

For the guidance given to us in helping us shape our project. Along with all the support when ever we were in doubt, we would like to thank J{\o}rgen Villadsen.

We would also like to thank Koen V. Hindriks for providing us the 
source code of the environments that comes with GOAL, so that we could quickly understand how to develop our own environment.
