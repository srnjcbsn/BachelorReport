\subsection{Converting Actions and Percepts}

Both actions and percepts are very abstract objects, and the XMAS
engine can not how they are represented in different APLs. This means
that the system designer needs a way to translate actions from foreign
types into \texttt{XmasAction}s, and \texttt{XmasPercept}s into percepts
of foreign types. We have provided the base necessities for implementing
this functionality with \emph{converters}. A converter is, as the
name implies, a class that takes objects of a foreign type and map
them to internal types or vice versa. \texttt{\emph{{[}Expand{]}}}
