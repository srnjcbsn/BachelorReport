In a multi-agent system, several intelligent agents act and interact
in an environment. The interacting of agents may be of any character,
the important part is that each agent can be aware of the others and
affect their execution \texttt{\emph{{[}rewrite{]}}}. As such, a system
in which agents compete for ressources and hinder other agents' progress
is a multi-agent system, as is a system in which the agents work together
towards a common goal. While the former may be used to simulate certain
systems, the latter is more interesting in software design, as such
an approach could conceivably lead to faster, decentralized problem
solving. A mixture of the two approaches can also be used, as in the
Multi-Agent Programming Contest \texttt{\emph{{[}Link{]}}} where teams
of cooperating agents compete for points. In this case, the goal is
