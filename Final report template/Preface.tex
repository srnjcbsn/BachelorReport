\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at the department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark in fulfilment of the
requirements for acquiring an B.Sc. in Informatics.

Although multi-agent systems is a field with a lot of research, there are not many tools aimed at designing or setting up environments for these systems. This problem is compounded by the fact that there are many capable agent programming languages (APLs). In this project we will explain and showcase the design of our Xmas Engine designed specifically communicate with different APLs in the same environment. Furthermore the engine is also designed to be used for any type of environment. Along with the engine we provide a reference implemention (with agent programs written in GOAL) showing the abilities of the Xmas Engine.
