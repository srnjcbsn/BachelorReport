In this project, we have developed an engine for constructing scenarios
to be used in multi-agent systems. A scenario in this sense is an
environment where agents can interact, and with means to control the
agents. Our project provides the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item A way to set up environments.
\item Means of communicating with APLs, which controls the agents inhabiting
the environment.
\item Provide a general way for agents to behave in the environment, by
allowing them to \emph{act} and \emph{sense}.
\item Reactivity in the environments, allowing agents and entities to dynamically
respond to changes in the world.
\end{itemize}

\section*{What has been done, what needs to be done}

All of our goals for the engine have -- to some extent -- been reached.
However, There are many aspects of the engine which could be severely
improved. These include, but is not limited to, 
\begin{itemize}
\item The specific way actions and events are designed. For instance, the
distinction between environment events and entity events, as discussed
in section \texttt{\emph{{[}insert section number{]}}}.
\item The way the view is supposed to communicate with the model
\item The way agent controllers are forced to have their own threads. This
is a unnecessary when APLs runs all agents on a single thread, however
inefficient that may be.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Future work}

Here, we will list some of the possible additions to the engine, which
would make it easier to use by providing functionality for a wide
array of MAS scenarios.
\begin{itemize}
\item Extensions to communicate with other APLs, that do not support the
EIS standard.
\item A collection of common environments, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Three dimensional worlds
\item A graph based world
\end{itemize}
\item An extension allowing construction and management of discrete worlds.
\item Extensing the reference implementation to include agents cooperating
finding packages. Or copying the environment and functionality of
the Agents on Mars scenario, to showcase and test our engine against
an established implementation.
\item A collection of commonly used agent actions and percepts, such as
means of communicating with each other.\end{itemize}
