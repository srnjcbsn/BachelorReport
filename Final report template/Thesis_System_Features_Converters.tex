\section{Converting Actions and Percepts}

Both actions and percepts are very abstract objects, and the XMAS
engine can not know how they are represented in different APLs. This
means that the system designer needs a way to translate actions from
foreign types -- such as GOAL actions -- into \texttt{XmasAction}s,
and \texttt{XmasPercept}s into percepts of foreign types. We have
provided the base necessities for implementing this functionality
with \emph{converters}. A converter is, as the name implies, a class
that takes objects of a foreign type and map them to internal types
or vice versa. 

To use our converter, the designer simply extends the \texttt{XmasConversionTool}
class, then proceeds to define what foreign type he wishes to convert
from or to an internal \texttt{XmasType}. After this, the user defines
each individual object of the foreign type by extending the \texttt{XmasConverter}
class. Once this task is complete, the converter objects are added
to the Tool object, and conversion between foreign and internal types
are now possible. 

This feature is used as part of our EIS extension for converting IILang
data into XMAS percepts/actions.
